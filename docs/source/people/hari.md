## Bio

Hari Krishnan holds a Ph.D. in computer science and leads the Software Design for Experimental Science Group. As a
computer systems engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, his research focuses on scientific visualization on
HPC platforms and many-core architectures. He leads the development effort on several HPC-related projects which
includes research on new visualization methods, optimizing scaling and performance on NERSC machines, working on data
model optimized I/O libraries, and enabling remote workflow services. As a member of The Center for Advanced Mathematics
for Energy Research Applications(CAMERA), he supports the development of the software infrastructure, works on
accelerating image analysis algorithms and reconstruction techniques. He is also an active developer of several major
open-source projects which include VisIt, NiCE, H5hut, and has developed plugins that support performant-centric
scalable image filtering and analysis routines in Fiji/ImageJ.
