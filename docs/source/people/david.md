## Bio

David Perlmutter is a Project Scientist in the Software Design for Experimental Science Group at LBNL. He received an MS
in electrical engineering at the University of Washington studying iterative CT image reconstruction algorithms,
particularly in noise modeling to enable ultra low-dose scans for clinical applications. Prior to joining LBNL, he spent
6 years at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, working on a variety of applied signal processing and machine
learning problems in optical/RF communication and remote sensing. He is currently interested in applying signal
processing and machine learning solutions to build practical tools to help scientists collect and analyze beamline data.
