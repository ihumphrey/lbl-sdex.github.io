# Cookiecutter

[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
is a utility that can be used to define project templates
and create new projects from these templates.

## Motivation

By writing custom cookiecutters, SDEX can create software projects on GitHub 
that are more standardized and uniform in their project structures.
Additionally, these custom cookiecutters facilitate better programming practices by incorporating
CI (GitHub Actions), code metrics (CodeCov), and documentation (Sphinx + ReadTheDocs)
boilerplate to reduce the barrier-to-entry for setting up these types of tools.

## Python Cookiecutter

To create a new Python project distributable via PyPI and GitHub Releases,
see [our python cookiecutter repository](https://github.com/ihumphrey/cookiecutter-pypackage#readme).
